`DeviceKit` is a value-type replacement of [`UIDevice`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIDevice_Class/).

## Changelog
Here you find an overview about all the latest features, bugfixes and breaking changes shipped with version 2.0 which was released on 10<sup>th</sup> April 2019.
### Breaking changes version 2.0
- The original `Device()` constructor has been made private in favour of using `Device.current` to match `UIDevice.current`.
- The enum values for the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone X Ä have been renamed to be `.iPhoneXS`, `.iPhoneXSMax` and `.iPhoneXR` to match proper formatting.
- `.description` for the iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max and iPhone X Ä have been changed to contain small caps formatting for the s and the  Ä part.
- `.description` for the iPad 5 and iPad 6 have been changed to the proper names; iPad (5<sup>th</sup> generation) and iPad (6<sup>th</sup> generation).
- `.name`, `.systemName`, `.systemVersion`, `.model`, `.localizedModel`, `.batteryState` and `.batteryLevel` will now all return nil when you try to get its value when the device you are getting it from isn't the current one. (eg. `Device.iPad6.name` while running on iPad 5)

### New features
- Updated to Swift 5!
- New `.allDevicesWithRoundedDisplayCorners` and `.hasRoundedDisplayCorners` values to check if a device has rounded display corners. (eg. iPhone Xs and iPad Pro (3<sup>rd</sup> generation))
- new `.allDevicesWithSensorHousing` and `.hasSensorHousing` values to check if a device has a screen cutout for the sensor housing. (eg. iPhone Xs)

### Bugfixes
- `.isPad` and `.isPhone` are now giving correct outputs again.

## Installation
DeviceKit can be installed in various ways.

### CocoaPods

```
#### Swift 4.0 - Swift 4.2
```ruby
pod 'DeviceKit', '~> 1.3'
```
#### Swift 3
```ruby
pod 'DeviceKit', '~> 1.2.3'
```
#### Swift 2.3 (Unsupported)
```ruby
pod 'DeviceKit', :git => 'https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit.git', :branch => 'swift-2.3-unsupported'
```

### Carthage

#### Swift 5
```ogdl
github "devicekit/DeviceKit" ~> 2.0
```
#### Swift 4.0 - Swift 4.2
```ogdl
github "devicekit/DeviceKit" ~> 1.3
```
#### Swift 3
```ogdl
github "devicekit/DeviceKit" ~> 1.2.3
```
#### Swift 2.3 (Unsupported)
```ogdl
github "devicekit/DeviceKit" "swift-2.3-unsupported"
```

### Manually
To install it manually, drag the `DeviceKit` project into your app project in Xcode. Or add it as a git submodule by running:
```bash
$ git submodule add https://github.com/devicekit/DeviceKit.git
```

## Usage
First make sure to import the framework:
```swift
import DeviceKit
```

Here are some usage examples. All devices are also available as simulators:
```swift
.iPhone6 => .simulator(.iPhone6)
.iPhone6s => .simulator(.iPhone6s)
```

You can try these examples in Playground.

**Note:**

> To try DeviceKit in the playground, open the `DeviceKit.xcworkspace` and build DeviceKit.framework for any simulator first by selecting "DeviceKit" as your current scheme.

### Get the Device You're Running On
```swift
let device = Device.current

print(device)     // prints, for example, "iPhone 6 Plus"

if device == .iPhone6Plus {
  // Do something
} else {
  // Do something else
}
```

### Get the Device Family
```swift
let device = Device.current
if device.isPod {
  // iPods (real or simulator)
} else if device.isPhone {
  // iPhone (real or simulator)
} else if device.isPad {
  // iPad (real or simulator)
}
```

### Check If Running on Simulator
```swift
let device = Device.current
if device.isSimulator {
  // Running on one of the simulators(iPod/iPhone/iPad)
  // Skip doing something irrelevant for Simulator
} 
```

### Get the Simulator Device
```swift
let device = Device.current
switch device {
case .simulator(.iPhone6s): break // You're running on the iPhone 6s simulator
case .simulator(.iPadAir2): break // You're running on the iPad Air 2 simulator
default: break
}
```
 
### Make Sure the Device Is Contained in a Preconfigured Group
```swift
let groupOfAllowedDevices: [Device] = [.iPhone6, .iPhone6Plus, .iPhone6s, .iPhone6sPlus, .simulator(.iPhone6), .simulator(.iPhone6Plus),.simulator(.iPhone6s),.simulator(.iPhone6sPlus).simulator(.iPhone8),.simulator(.iPhone8Plus),.simulator(.iPhoneX),.simulator(.iPhoneXS),.simulator(.iPhoneXSMax),.simulator(.iPhoneXR)]

let device = Device.current
 
if device.isOneOf(groupOfAllowedDevices) {
  // Do your action
}
```

### Get the Current Battery State
**Note:**

> To get the current battery state we need to set `UIDevice.current.isBatteryMonitoringEnabled` to `true`. To avoid any issues with your code, we read the current setting and reset it to what it was before when we're done.

```swift
if device.batteryState == .full || device.batteryState >= .charging(75) {
  print("Your battery is happy! üòä")
}
```

### Get the Current Battery Level
```swift
if device.batteryLevel >= 50 {
  install_iOS()
} else {
  showError()
}
```

### Get Low Power mode status
```swift
if device.batteryState.lowPowerMode {
  print("Low Power mode is enabled! üîã")
} else {
  print("Low Power mode is disabled! üòä")
}
```

### Check if a Guided Access session is currently active
```swift
if device.isGuidedAccessSessionActive {
  print("Guided Access session is currently active")
} else {
  print("No Guided Access session is currently active")
}
```

### Get Screen Brightness
```swift
if device.screenBrightness > 50 {
  print("Take care of your eyes!")
}
```

### Get Available Disk Space
```swift
if Device.volumeAvailableCapacityForOpportunisticUsage ?? 0 > Int64(1_000_000) {
  // download that nice-to-have huge file
}

if Device.volumeAvailableCapacityForImportantUsage ?? 0 > Int64(1_000) {
  // download that file you really need
}
```
